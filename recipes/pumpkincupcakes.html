        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This pumpkin cupcake recipe is an amateur's take on an exquisite and undoubtedly professional recipe from none other than the food network. <br> What makes this an amateur's recipe? In my first ever attempt at constructing these pumpkin cupcakes as an act of gratitude for a friend of mine, <br>I made a fateful mistake: I forgot the milk. Almond milk, that is. Thus, the key to these cupcakes is to forget the milk.</p>
