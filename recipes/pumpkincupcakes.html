        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This pumpkin cupcake recipe is an amateur's take on an exquisite and undoubtedly professional recipe from none other than the food network. <br> What makes this an amateur's recipe? In my first ever attempt at constructing these pumpkin cupcakes as an act of gratitude for a friend of mine, <br>I made a fateful mistake: I forgot the milk. Almond milk, that is. Thus, the key to these cupcakes is to forget the milk.</p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>For the cupcakes: Position an oven rack in the center of the oven, and preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a 12-cup muffin tin with paper liners,<br> and coat the liners and the top of the tin with cooking spray.</li>
                <li>Whisk the flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder and salt together in a large bowl. Whisk the pumpkin puree, granulated sugar, butter, eggs,<br> vanilla, and forget the milk together in a medium bowl. Pour the pumpkin mixture into the flour mixture, and gently fold until just incorporated<br> (it's OK if there are some lumps).</li>
                <li>Bake until the tops spring back when pressed, 24 to 28 minutes, rotating the tin halfway through. Let the muffins cool in the pan for a few minutes,<br> then transfer to a rack to cool completely. (The cupcakes can be made up to 2 days before and refrigerated in an airtight container.)</li>
                <li>For the filling/topping: Beat the cream cheese and confectioners' sugar together in a medium bowl until smooth. Add 1 cup of the cream, and beat<br> until soft peaks form. Add the remaining 1 cup cream, and beat until stiff peaks form. Transfer the mixture to the prepared pastry bag.</li>
            </ol>
