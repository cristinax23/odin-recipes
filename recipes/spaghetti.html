            <li>Place your ground beef in a large pan and turn heat on High.</li>
            <li>Begin to stir/sautee the ground beef while spreading the beef apart evenly throughout the pan. Add your sazón.</li>
            <li>Once the beef is browned and fully cooked, add your garlic powder.</li>
            <li>Add your tomato basil sauce to the ground beef. Stir.</li>
            <li>Add a dash of heavy cream in an 'S' shape in your ground beef/sauce pan. Stir.</li>
            <li>In a deep pot, bring water to a boil.</li>
            <li>Once the water has reached boiling, add your spaghetti rigate. Keep spaghetti noodles separated as they boil to avoid sticking.</li>
            <li>Once your spaghetti noodles are properly cooked, strain the water out of the pot.</li>
            <li>Transfer noodles back into the pot and add olive oil to the noodles to prevent sticking.</li>
