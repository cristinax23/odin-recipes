            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>bread of your choice (sourdough, rye, or artesano recommended)</li>
                <li>ham</li>
                <li>swiss cheese</li>
                <li>2-3 eggs(brown)</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Toast your bread in a toaster. Be sure to make it nice and burnt, this recipe does not like soft, white, untoasted bread. It calls for dark bread, near-burnt<br> if you can stand it.</li>
                <li>While your bread is toasting, crack your eggs and whisk them up for the scrambled eggs. This step can be altered to your own egg preferences, if fried<br> eggs are more your speed.</li>
                <li>Scramble or fry your eggs. Your bread should be toasted by now, so the next step is to place the swiss cheese and ham onto your slices of toast. Make<br> sure that the cheese is sitting on the bread rather than the ham, as this is how we achieve nice, melty cheese.</li>
                <li>With your slices of toast now decorated with swiss cheese and ham on each respective slice, place them in a toaster oven to melt the cheese and warm up<br> the ham. We do not accept cold, slimey ham.</li>
                <li>Once the eggs are scrambled and the cheese is melted to perfection, it is time to take your toast out of the toaster oven and place the scrambled eggs on<br> one of the slices. Top the other slice overtop.</li>
                <li>Serve and enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
